# UnitTesting

Start with the AccountOperationsTests.cs file for completing the unit tests. There are various noted in the unit tests and the various files.
**The goal is to update the AccountOperations class** in a way that allows you to test the class without involving external dependencies.

You can use any Mock framework that you are familiar with to bypass the external dependency. In this project I used Moq https://github.com/moq/moq4
